• Regarding the criterion “A Video Presentation that, as a standalone item, a school-leaver should be able to follow, with a well-stated starting point, project work description and conclusions”, the physicists thought:

The video is describes the project very well. The video gives a good description of the project. I liked the fact you dug into details with the video, and didn't just describe with words. Excellent presentation of your project with lots of hands on demonstrations of the different elements. Most things described exceptionally well but at times the descriptions were also too technical.
Very clear explanations, engaging, sometimes too complex e.g. when describing the optics and lasers. I think a school leaver would have a reasonably good idea of what you were doing. However, I think you could have improved the digestibility by embedding some diagrams in your video directly to describe the key concepts rather than videoing pictures of your diagrams. Your coverage seems very accessible, though I must admit that I build confocal microscopes myself for real! Perhaps you could have pressed home the importance of the pinhole in how this functions. While a school leaver would be able to understand the principles, too much unexplained technical jargon was used (the level of content was appropriate though).

• For “Clear descriptions of the trial-and-error studies and decisions that shaped the project”, they said:

I would have liked more details of the decision making, instead you described mostly the results. This was very well described. Lots of good stuff about what did and what didn't work and how you went about solving problems. Difficulties and solutions were clearly expressed although not much indication of this in the initial process of design (becomes clear in 'improvements' section).

• For “The quality and quantitative nature of the result”:

Very good results! I like your plot of the z-scans. It was great that you managed to get interesting quantitative results from your system. It would have been really nice had you been able to build up an image!. Your z-scans looked good and your demonstration of measurement accuracy are really believable. Great quantitative analysis, considerate exploration of results and what to present, although there is room for improvement.

• And finally, for “Evidence in the video and write-up of good teamwork across all team members”, their comments were:

Some evidence given,. It looked like there was good team work involved in this sophisticated project. All team members seem very enthusiastic about what they have done and really seem to understand their problem. It seems that all team members contributed to all aspects to at least some extent and all team members worked appropriate amounts, even if in different areas.

The Y1Project is intended as a prototype for all sorts of collaborative research and presentation work that you will do during the course of your degree and beyond, from some of the Professional Skills training this year, to Research Interfaces and your BSc or MSci Projects you will do in your final year. The more you progress, the closer to real cutting-edge research you will find yourself, and I hope you can take the experience from the Y1Project and the ideas in the feedback above, keeping the best things about what you did, improving on things that you could have done better, and most importantly—carrying on having fun!
